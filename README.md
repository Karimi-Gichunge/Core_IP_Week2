# Overview of study
Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.

Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.

# Research Question
The research problem is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. The solution will help provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ financial outcomes.

# Method
The study uses Exploratory Data Analysis, i.e Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis and Multivariate Analysis. In the study we seek to answer the following questions.
1. Are females more likely to own a bank account than males
2. Are people in urban areas more likely to own a bank account than those in rural areas
3. What age group of people is most likely to own a bank account
4. Are educated people more likely to own a bank account and so on
